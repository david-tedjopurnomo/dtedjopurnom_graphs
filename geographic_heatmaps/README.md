I used [Google Maps heatmap layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/heatmaplayer) for these two plots.

You need access to the Google Cloud API. This solution requires you to take screenshots from the google map API, which is inelegant. However, I have searched for some Python libraries that allows you to draw heatmaps over geographic maps, but they cannot display as many points as Google Maps'.
